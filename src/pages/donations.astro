                With the global COVID-19 pandemic now spreading quickly in South
                Africa, local communities are feeling the devastating effects of
                the virus. With the South African tourism industry being hit
                hardest by the outbreak, many people have lost their jobs due to
                the lockdown measures. We are committed to continue offering
                health & safety support to these vulnerable communities for as
                long as this pandemic remains, but Hlokomela needs your help to
                do this.

                Limpopo is one of the worst areas in South Africa for poverty,
                whilst lacking basic facilities in the local villages such as
                running water. Hlokomela is an established non-profit clinic
                committed to serving farm workers and their families. Our goal
                is to provide a cost-effective and sustainable way to screen for
                and treat breast cancer, preventing hundreds of deaths each
                year.
